# /finish

Run the development workflow completion tasks.

## Steps to execute:

1. Run `npm run format` to format all documents
2. Run `npm run lint` for error checking
3. Run `mkdocs build` for build documents

All four commands must pass successfully before considering the work complete. If any command fails, fix the issues before proceeding to the next command.
